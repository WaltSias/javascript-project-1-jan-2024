I re-watched the classes for that week and saw my mistakes i was using both the function and writing out each "let" out. I realized where to put the alert listener but was confused at first. the video class on youtube really helped out. Im saying this because I once knew how to do this while I was in class but was so confused as of now, that is why keeping up with projects are important.
